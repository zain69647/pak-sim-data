# PAK SIM DATABASE - Premium Golden Edition

## Vercel Deployment

This project now includes a Vercel-ready version:

- `index.html` - static frontend used by Vercel
- `style.css` - plain CSS for the frontend
- `api/search.js` - Vercel serverless API route
- `vercel.json` - Vercel route configuration
- `.vercelignore` - prevents old PHP files from being deployed
- `.gitignore` - prevents sensitive/local files from being committed

### Deploy Through GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload or push these Vercel files:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `api/search.js`
   - `vercel.json`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `.vercelignore`
3. Do not upload `config.php`, `setup.php`, `index.php`, `style.php`, `css.php`, or `logs/` for the Vercel deployment.
4. Open Vercel and click **Add New Project**.
5. Import your GitHub repository.
6. Keep the framework preset as **Other**.
7. Deploy.

The site will call `/api/search`, and Vercel will run `api/search.js` as the serverless function.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Files to InfinityFree

1. Go to your InfinityFree account dashboard
2. Click **File Manager**
3. Navigate to the **public_html** folder
4. Upload all these files:
   - `index.php`
   - `config.php`
   - `css.php`
   - `style.php`
   - `setup.php`
   - `README.md`

### Step 2: Get Your Database Credentials

1. In InfinityFree dashboard, go to **MySQL Databases**
2. Create a new database (if not already created)
3. Note down:
   - **Database Name** (e.g., `if0_xxxxx_simdb`)
   - **Database User** (e.g., `if0_xxxxx`)
   - **Database Password**
   - **Host** (usually `localhost`)

### Step 3: Update config.php

1. Open `config.php` in your file manager
2. Replace these lines with your actual credentials:

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 'if0_xxxxx');      // Your database user
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');  // Your database password
define('DB_NAME', 'if0_xxxxx_simdb'); // Your database name
```

3. Save the file

### Step 4: Initialize the Database

1. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   https://yoursite.infinityfree.com/setup.php
   ```
   (Replace `yoursite` with your actual domain)

2. You should see a success message: **"✓ Database Setup Successful!"**

3. **IMPORTANT:** Delete `setup.php` from your file manager after setup is complete (for security)

### Step 5: Access Your Website

Visit: `https://yoursite.infinityfree.com/index.php`

Your website is now live! 🎉

## 📊 How Statistics Work

The application tracks:
- **Total Users**: Unique IP addresses that have performed searches
- **Total Checks**: Total number of searches performed
- **Live Status**: Shows "LIVE" when the server is running

All data is stored in the `search_logs` table in your MySQL database.

## 🔧 File Descriptions

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.php` | Main application file with search interface |
| `config.php` | Database configuration and functions |

## ⚠️ Security Notes

1. **Delete setup.php** after database setup is complete
2. **Keep config.php secure** - it contains database credentials
3. **Use HTTPS** - InfinityFree provides free SSL certificates
4. **Backup regularly** - Keep backups of your database

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed" Error
- Check if database credentials in `config.php` are correct
- Verify database user has proper permissions
- Ensure MySQL database is created

### "Page Unavailable" Error
- Check if all files are uploaded to `public_html`
- Verify file permissions (should be 644 for PHP files)
- Check InfinityFree server status

### Statistics Not Updating
- Ensure database tables were created successfully via `setup.php`
- Verify database connection in `config.php`
- Check if search_logs table exists in database
